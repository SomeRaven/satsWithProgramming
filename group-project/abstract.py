## Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of suicide death rates across diverse demographic groups in the United States over a {years_span}-year period (1950-2018), utilizing data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). Understanding patterns and disparities in suicide mortality is critically important for public health policy, as suicide remains a leading cause of death in the United States, with rates varying dramatically across age, sex, racial, and ethnic groups—from as low as {rate_range[0]:.1f} to as high as {rate_range[1]:.1f} deaths per 100,000 population. Previous research by Murphy et al. (2021) and longitudinal studies from the NCHS have documented concerning trends in suicide mortality, particularly noting that rates have {trend_direction} by approximately {abs(percent_change):.1f}% since 2000, with certain demographic subgroups experiencing disproportionately high rates that warrant targeted intervention strategies. This analysis aims to answer four key research questions: (1) How have suicide death rates changed over time for different demographic groups? (2) Which populations experience the highest risk and show the most concerning trends? (3) What patterns exist in age-specific and sex-specific suicide rates? and (4) Are there identifiable periods where rates significantly increased or decreased that correlate with historical events or policy changes? Upon completion of this project, we anticipate identifying high-risk demographic groups that require enhanced mental health resources, uncovering temporal patterns that may inform prevention strategies, quantifying disparities across race, ethnicity, age, and sex categories, and providing evidence-based recommendations for targeted suicide prevention programs that could ultimately reduce mortality rates in the most vulnerable populations.
